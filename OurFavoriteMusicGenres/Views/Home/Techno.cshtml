                    Techno is a subgenre of electronic dance music (EDM) whose pace frequently ranges between 120 and 150 beats per minute and is typically composed for usage in a continuous DJ set (bpm). Common time (4/4) is usually used for the core rhythm, which is frequently distinguished by a repeating four-on-the-floor beat. Digital audio workstations and electronic instruments like drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers are available for artists to use. Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines from the 1980s are widely sought-after, and software imitations of these vintage instruments are well-liked.

                    Techno music frequently emphasizes the importance of rhythm over other musical elements in its orchestration. Techno tracks primarily involve the manipulation of the timbral qualities of preset synthesizers, and unlike EDM styles that frequently use synthesizer keyboards, techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic conventions of Western music. Instead, it frequently eschews these structures in favor of timbral manipulation alone. The widespread acceptance of innovative use of music production technology is another characteristic of techno music and the techno aesthetic.

                    The term "techno" was first used to describe a kind of electronic music in Germany in the early 1980s. The term "Techno" became connected with a type of EDM created in Detroit in 1988, following the UK publication of the compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit. Detroit techno is the consequence of the fusion of African American sounds like house, electro, and funk with synth-pop by musicians like Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. The impact of science-fiction and futuristic ideas that are pertinent to American late-capitalist culture is also added to this, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave serving as a prominent point of reference.The music produced in the mid-to-late 1980s by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as The Belleville Three), along with Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter, James Pennington and others is viewed as the first wave of techno from Detroit.

                    After house music became popular in several European nations, techno gained traction in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Regional variations immediately arose in Europe, and by the beginning of the 1990s, techno subgenres such acid, hardcore, bleep, ambient, and dub had emerged. Techno enthusiasts and music critics typically use the phrase sparingly, making it possible to distinguish between genres like tech house and trance that are sometimes conceptually similar but frequently qualitatively unique.
