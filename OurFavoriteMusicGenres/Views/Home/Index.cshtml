                        I am a fourth-year Information Technology student with a specialization in Software Development. I am from Cincinnati, OH, and have lived here my entire life. Despite living here my whole life, I would like to travel the country/world after graduating before starting the next chapter of my life. I love playing video games, cooking, singing, and hiking. On campus, I am a UC Choruses member and the social chair.
                        <br />Indie Folk has been my favorite genre of music for many years, and it stems from my love of nature and Autumn. When listening to Indie Folk, I often feel like I’m walking through a forest. There is a slight nip in the air, and I can only hear the crunch of the leaves under my feet. This feeling is very comforting for me.
