                        I am a fourth-year Information Technology student with a specialization in Software Development. I am from Cincinnati, OH, and have lived here my entire life. Despite living here my whole life, I would like to travel the country/world after graduating before starting the next chapter of my life. I love playing video games, cooking, singing, and hiking. On campus, I am a UC Choruses member and the social chair.
                        <br />Indie Folk has been my favorite genre of music for many years, and it stems from my love of nature and Autumn. When listening to Indie Folk, I often feel like I’m walking through a forest. There is a slight nip in the air, and I can only hear the crunch of the leaves under my feet. This feeling is very comforting for me.

                            Hi! My name is Lilly and I’m in my 4th year at UC. My major is in
                            Information Technology with a track in software development.
                            Outside of school, I love to read, do outdoor activities
